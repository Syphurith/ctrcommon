###Common utilities for use in 3DS homebrew.

Compilation Requirements

* [devkitARM](http://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/files/devkitARM/) installed, latest version preferred.
* [aemstro](https://github.com/smealum/aemstro) clone this to your devkitpro directory, such as `D:\STATION\devkitPro\aemstro`.
* [ctrulib](https://github.com/smealum/ctrulib) clone this, and build it from source, and `make install` to install it to your devkitPro directory.
* **Python** This is indeed a requirement for `aemstro`. However you would need to use `aemstro` to proceed some files, so i add it here.

Run 'make' to build, and run 'make install' to install it to your devkitPro directory.
